<span class="s2">Related Packages 
================ 
</span>
<span class="s0">These are some python packages that have a related purpose and can be</span>
<span class="s0">useful in combination with statsmodels. The selection in this list is</span>
<span class="s0">biased towards packages that might be directly useful for data handling and</span>
<span class="s0">statistical analysis, and towards those that have a BSD compatible license, </span>
<span class="s0">which implies that we are not restricted in looking at the source to learn </span>
<span class="s0">of different ways of implementation or of different algorithms. </span>
<span class="s0">The following descriptions are taken from the websites with small adjustments.</span>



<span class="s2">Data Handling 
------------- 
</span>
<span class="s2">Scikits.timeseries 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.timeseries</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Time series manipulation</span>

<span class="s0">The scikits.timeseries module provides classes and functions for manipulating, </span>
<span class="s0">reporting, and plotting time series of various frequencies. The focus is on </span>
<span class="s0">convenient data access and manipulation while leveraging the existing </span>
<span class="s0">mathematical functionality in Numpy and SciPy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Licence: BSD</span>
<span class="s0">Language: Python, C, binary distributions available</span>

 
<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>

<span class="s0">Timeseries is based on numpys MaskedArray and is designed for handling data </span>
<span class="s0">with missing values. It also includes functions for statistical analysis.</span>


<span class="s2">Pandas 
^^^^^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This project aims to provide the following</span>
 <span class="s0">* A set of fast NumPy-based data structures optimized for panel, time series, </span>
   <span class="s0">and cross-sectional data analysis.</span>
 <span class="s0">* A set of tools for loading such data from various sources and providing </span>
   <span class="s0">efficient ways to persist the data. </span>
 <span class="s0">* A robust statistics and econometrics library which closely integrates with </span>
   <span class="s0">the core data structures.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">License: New BSD</span>
<span class="s0">Language: Python, Cython, </span>
<span class="s0">binary distribution available for win32-py25, but easy to build with MinGW</span>

<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>

<span class="s0">Uses statsmodels as optional dependency for statistical analysis, but has</span>
<span class="s0">additional statistical and econometrics algorithms that focus on panel data </span>
<span class="s0">analysis, mostly in the time dimension. It has several data structures that </span>
<span class="s0">allow dictionary access to the underlying 1, 2, or 3 dimensional arrays. It </span>
<span class="s0">was initially focused on a two-dimensional representation of the data, but </span>
<span class="s0">now also allows for different representation of three-dimensional arrays. It </span>
<span class="s0">allows for arbitrary axis labels, but offers also a convenient time series </span>
<span class="s0">class. </span>


<span class="s2">Tabular 
^^^^^^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabular</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tabular data container and associated convenience routines in Python</span>

<span class="s0">Tabular is a package of Python modules for working with tabular data. Its main </span>
<span class="s0">object is the tabarray class, a data structure for holding and manipulating </span>
<span class="s0">tabular data. </span>

<span class="s0">The tabarray object is based on the ndarray object from the Numerical Python </span>
<span class="s0">package (NumPy), and the Tabular package is built to interface well with NumPy </span>
<span class="s0">in general. &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">License: MIT</span>
<span class="s0">Language: Python</span>

<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>

<span class="s0">Uses numpys structured arrays as basic building block. Focused on </span>
<span class="s0">spreadsheet-style operations for working with two-dimensional tables and </span>
<span class="s0">associated data handling and analysis.</span>
<span class="s0">It is instructive to read the code of tabular for working with structured </span>
<span class="s0">arrays. </span>


<span class="s2">La 
^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/la</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Label the rows, columns, any dimension, of your NumPy arrays.</span>

<span class="s0">The main class of the la package is a labeled array, larry. A larry consists of </span>
<span class="s0">a data array and a label list. The data array is stored as a NumPy array and </span>
<span class="s0">the label list as a list of lists. &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">License: BSD</span>
<span class="s0">Language: Python</span>

<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>

<span class="s0">The data handling is in intention similar to pandas but closer to working</span>
<span class="s0">with standard numpy ndarrays. The main addition to numpy arrays are</span>
<span class="s0">arbitrary labels for each axis of the array. Larry delegates to numpy </span>
<span class="s0">functions but does not subclass numpy's ndarrays. It also provides functions</span>
<span class="s0">for basic descriptive statistics.</span>

<span class="s0">far the most mature project in this group including statsmodels.</span>


<span class="s2">Scikits.talkbox 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.talkbox</span>

<span class="s0">Talkbox is set of python modules for speech/signal processing. The goal of this</span>

<span class="s0">Language: Python, C optional</span>


<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>

<span class="s0">Although specialized on speech processing, talkbox has some accessible and</span>
<span class="s0">useful functions for time series analysis, especially a fast implementation</span>
<span class="s0">for estimating AR models (with ...) and spectral density based on estimated</span>
<span class="s0">AR coefficients.</span>

<span class="s0">It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in </span>
<span class="s0">the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent </span>
<span class="s0">time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the </span>
<span class="s0">numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with </span>
<span class="s0">compact and semantically clear code.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">License: BSD</span>
<span class="s0">Language: Python</span>

<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>
<span class="s0">Althoug focused on neuroscience, the algorithms for time series analysis are</span>
<span class="s0">independent of the data representation and can be used with numpy arrays.</span>
<span class="s0">Current focus is on spectral analysis including coherence between several</span>
<span class="s0">time series.</span>


<span class="s2">KF - Kalman Filter 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
</span>
<span class="s3">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/KF</span>

<span class="s4">*Comments*</span>
<span class="s0">Very young project but with a similar, although narrower, focus as pandas</span>
<span class="s0">and (parts of) statsmodels. Uses Kalman Filter for rolling linear regression </span>
<span class="s0">and allows for equality and inequality constraints in the estimation. </span>
<span class="s0">Includes its own time series class, and the estimation seems (?) to depend on</span>
<span class="s0">it. </span>



<span class="s2">Domain-specific Data Analysis 
----------------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s0">The following packages contain interesting statistical algorithms, however</span>
<span class="s0">they are tightly focused on their application, and are or might be more </span>
<span class="s0">difficult to use &quot;from the outside&quot;. (Descriptions are taken from websites)</span>

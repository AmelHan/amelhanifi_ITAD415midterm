<span class="s2">************ 
Introduction 
************ 
</span>
<span class="s2">Background 
---------- 
</span>
<span class="s0">Scipy.stats.models was originally written by Jonathan Taylor.</span>
<span class="s0">For some time it was part of scipy but then removed from it. During</span>
<span class="s0">the Google Summer of Code 2009, stats.models was corrected, tested and </span>
<span class="s0">enhanced.</span>

<span class="s0">Now, we are releasing it as a standalone package in the scikits</span>
<span class="s0">namespace as </span><span class="s1">:mod:</span><span class="s3">`scikits.statsmodels` </span><span class="s0">to gain some experience with </span>
<span class="s0">actual usage of it. This scikits.statsmodels is intended to be eventually </span>
<span class="s0">re-included in scipy.</span>


<span class="s2">Current Status 
-------------- 
</span>
<span class="s0">statsmodels is a pure python package.</span>

<span class="s0">statsmodels includes:</span>

  <span class="s0">* regression: mainly OLS and generalized least squares, GLS</span>
    <span class="s0">including weighted least squares and least squares with AR</span>
    <span class="s0">errors.</span>
  <span class="s0">* glm: generalized linear models</span>
  <span class="s0">* rlm: robust linear models</span>
  <span class="s0">* discretemod: regression with discrete dependent variables, Logit, Probit, </span>
    <span class="s0">MNLogit, Poisson, based on maximum likelihood estimators </span>
  <span class="s0">* datasets: for examples and tests</span>

<span class="s0">The other code which we didn't have enough time to verify and fix</span>
<span class="s0">was moved to a sandbox folder. The formula framework is not used any</span>
<span class="s0">more (in the verified code). The sandbox also contains models and functions</span>
<span class="s0">that we are currently developing, partially unfinished and not fully tested.</span>

<span class="s0">Compared to the original code, the class structure and some of the</span>
<span class="s0">method arguments have changed. Additional estimation</span>
<span class="s0">results, e.g. test statistics have been included.</span>

<span class="s0">Most importantly, most results have been verified with at least one </span>
<span class="s0">other statistical package: R, Stata or SAS. The guiding principal for the </span>
<span class="s0">rewrite was that all numbers have to be verified, even if we don't manage </span>
<span class="s0">to cover everything. There are a few remaining issues, that we hope to </span>
<span class="s0">clear up soon. Not all parts of the code have been tested for unexpected </span>
<span class="s0">inputs and been made robust against them. Additionally, many of the tests </span>
<span class="s0">call rpy to compare the results directly with R. We use an extended </span>
<span class="s0">wrapper for R models in the test suite. This provides greater flexibility </span>
<span class="s0">writing new test cases, but will eventually be replaced by hard coded </span>
<span class="s0">expected results.</span>

<span class="s0">The code is written for plain NumPy arrays.</span>

<span class="s0">We have also included several datasets from the public domain and by</span>
<span class="s0">permission for the tests and examples.  The datasets follow</span>
<span class="s0">fairly closely David Cournapeau's datasets proposal in</span>
<span class="s0">scikits.learn, with some small modifications. The datasets</span>
<span class="s0">are set up so that it is easy to add more datasets.</span>

<span class="s2">Looking Forward 
--------------- 
</span>
<span class="s0">We are distributing statsmodels as a standalone package to gain </span>
<span class="s0">experience with the API, and to allow us to make changes without </span>
<span class="s0">being committed to backwards compatibility. It will also give us </span>
<span class="s0">the opportunity to find and kill some remaining bugs, and fill </span>
<span class="s0">some holes in our test suite. However, statsmodels is intended </span>
<span class="s0">to become part of scipy after some maturing of the package.</span>

<span class="s0">Summer 2009, there was a discussion on the nipy</span>
<span class="s0">mailing list on the structure of the API and about possible</span>
<span class="s0">additional methods for the model classes. We would like</span>
<span class="s0">to invite everyone to give statsmodels a test drive and report</span>
<span class="s0">comments and possibilities for improvement and bugs to the </span>
<span class="s0">scipy-user or statsmodels mailing lists or file tickets on our </span>
<span class="s0">bug tracker at </span><span class="s4">https://bugs.launchpad.net/statsmodels</span>

<span class="s0">The development repository is at </span><span class="s4">http://code.launchpad.net/statsmodels </span><span class="s0">.</span>


<span class="s0">We would also like to use statsmodels, or projects related to it, as </span>
<span class="s0">a staging ground for new models. The current maintainers</span>
<span class="s0">are mostly interested in econometrics and time series analysis,</span>
<span class="s0">but we would like to invite any users or developers to contribute</span>
<span class="s0">their own extensions to existing models or new models.</span>
<span class="s0">statsmodels also contains some additional models in a sandbox folder. </span>
<span class="s0">Those models were part of the original stats.models, but there was not</span>
<span class="s0">enough time during GSOC 2009 to test, correct and refactor them. Any</span>
<span class="s0">help to clean them up and bring them towards our testing standards</span>
<span class="s0">would be very appreciated. Whether additional models are included in </span>
<span class="s0">scipy or remain separate can be discussed as they mature.</span>

<span class="s0">statsmodels is distributed under the same license as scipy (BSD) so </span>
<span class="s0">it can be readily integrated into scipy.</span>
